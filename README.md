# taikotrainer

A gameplay trainer for .tja and .osu taiko charts. Apart from viewing and playing charts starting from any point, features for speed change, density change, and checkpoints are also supported! Try it out right now [here](https://elziarr.github.io/taikotrainer/).

## Key Features

- Supports the main features of both .tja and .osu charts
- Easily seek and preview charts without having to start from the beginning
- Repeatedly practice specific parts by setting and restarting from checkpoints
- Change speed and note density to build up skill in tricky parts
- Remove note velocity changes and have a constant density for hard-to-read parts
- Enable autoplay to get a better feel of a chart's rhythm and difficulty

## Key Roadmap

- Add proper controller support (I can only test on keyboard right now ðŸ¥º)
- Properly support branches in .tja charts (it defaults to the hardest branch right now)
